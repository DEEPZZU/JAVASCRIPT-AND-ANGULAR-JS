# JAVASCRIPT-AND-ANGULAR-JS
AngularJS from basics to advance.
Pre-requisites : Html, CSS, Javascript and a basic knowledge of MVC

AngularJs is a javascript framework which supports MVC architectural pattern.
It has been licensed by Apache Org and maintained by Google (thats why you would find that all API would be supported by google).

# Why AngularJS ? 

It is cross-browser compliant i.e. each browser has its own javascript engine and a javascript code may produce error on one browser while running flexibly on ither, AngularJS simply takes all your worries away!
Secondly, it starts automatically once your browser starts.
Besides, there are other add-ons like it is open source, it supports MVC etc.

Will further keep on adding short notes for self-referencing! 
This is deezu signing off!!
Bye :)
